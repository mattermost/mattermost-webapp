Description
If a PR was created more than 14 days ago on GitHub, without being opted-in -- thus in an invalid state -- and was then opted-in, the PR would not be able to transition to a valid state.

It could not transition to the waiting state, as it passed the app's old review period check, but could also not enter the eligible state as this is locked behind being in the waiting state.

The simple fix here is to ensure that all PRs go through the waiting state (there is already duplicated logic that handles brand new PRs having their waiting since set to their creation date), before they ever enter the eligible state.
